# US_BikeShare
# Let's explore some US bikeshare data!
In this project, we are going to utilize Python and descriptive statistics concepts to explore data associated with bike share systems for three big cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The project answers some interesting basic statistical questions about the data.
# Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 3 questions related to given input:
1. Popular times of travel (times occurs most often in the start time)
  most common month
  most common day of week
  most common hour of day
2. Popular stations and trip
  most common start station
  most common end station
  most common trip from start to end (most frequent combination of start station and end station)
3. Trip duration
  total travel time
  average travel time
4. User info
  counts of each user type
  counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
  earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
# For our project We need to be familiar with two main types of descriptive statistics:
1. Measures of central tendency: mean(average), median and mode 
2. Measures of spread :  range, quartiles and the interquartile range, variance and standard deviation
# To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib library. They include:
- Create def funtion
- Using while loop
- Adding columns
- Processing datetime data
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
